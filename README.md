Exploring clustering as a way to create march madness bracket
Using over 100 features, can cluster all the recent march madness teams to this years bracket and see whcih teams are similar to predict if they will go on a run or not
This is mainly used for predicting upsets etc
Can use xgboost to try to predict round based on same features
